# Data Science EDA project

This repo contains an EDA project about the housing market of King County. 
The file 'EDA.ipynb' contains the project, while other files explain the task and recommended workflow.

To run the notebook on your machine please use python 3.9.8 and install the packages in the requirements.txt file into your virtual python environment.

Furthermore you will need to place the [King_County_House_prices_dataset.csv](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TTHG21AH3-F039X9ABZDL/download/king_county_house_prices_dataset.csv?origin_team=TTHG21AH3) and the [Zip_Codes.geojson](http://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/83fc2e72903343aabff6de8cb445b81c_2.geojson) in the 'data' folder

One part of the Project was a presentation which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WpitO-72zn0LWD8hdBfexfJAmLzTtTPnLsyebyMiaKo/edit?usp=sharing)
